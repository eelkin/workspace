So, we need to make a database connection, in the past we have done this with a context.xml with code like the following: 
<Context path="/homework4">
  
  <Resource auth="Container" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" 
            logAbandoned="true" maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000" 
            name="jdbc/MySQLDS" password="mysqluser" removeAbandoned="true" 
            removeAbandonedTimeout="60" type="javax.sql.DataSource" 
            url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tellingtales" username="root"/>
</Context>

But, we need an object to get a connection open that can also be decided by the user
